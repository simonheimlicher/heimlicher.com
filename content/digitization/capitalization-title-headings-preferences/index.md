Capitalization in English is a matter that confuses not only the non-native speakers. In my experience, preferences vary between organizations and countries around the world. In an attempt to remain consistent in my own writing, I have found the [Microsoft Style Guide]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization#title-style-capitalization)'s treatise of this topic to be quite helpful and would like to summarize it for the benefit of others in their quest for a universal set of rules.

Since I first published this article in 2008, more and more organizations have changed their style guide to use sentence case for titles and headings. Two examples are [UBS](https://www.ubs.com/) and [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), as seen on their websites.

> Microsoft style uses sentence-style capitalization. That means everything is lowercase except the first word and proper nouns, which include the names of brands, products, and services. 

## Sentence-style capitalization

1. Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as the name of a button or checkbox), or standalone phrase.
2. Capitalize proper nouns.
3. Use lowercase for everything else.

### Additional rules
1. Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Rewrite sentences that start with a word that's always lowercase.
2. Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. (It's OK to use italic sparingly for emphasis.)
3. Don't use all lowercase as a design choice. Although all uppercase is used occasionally as a design element, don't use it in text.
4. Don't use internal capitalization (such as AutoScale or e-Book) unless it's part of a brand name.
5. Don't capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
6.  When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized.
    * Examples
        * Country/Region
        * Turn on the On/Off toggle.

## Title-case capitalization

1. Always capitalize the **first** and last **words.**
     * Example: *A Home to Go Back To*
2. Don't capitalize *a,* *an,* or *the*.
     * Example: *The President on the Issues*
3. Don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters (such as *on, to, in, up, down, of,* and *for*) unless the preposition is the first or last word.
    * Examples
        * *To Learn Is to Change Your Life*
        * *This Is What I Am Looking For*
        * *Ryse: Son of Rome*
4. Don't capitalize *and,* *but,* *or,* *nor,* *yet,* or *so*.
    * Example
        * *Monitoring and Operating a Private or Hybrid Cloud*
5. Capitalize all other words, including nouns, verbs (including *is* and other forms of *be*), adverbs (including *very* and *too*), adjectives, and pronouns (including *this,* *that,* and *its*).
    * Examples
        * *Enterprise Agility Is Not an Oxymoron*
        * *This Is All There Is*
        * *Teaching Math Over and Over Again, in Less Time Than Before*
6. Capitalize the word after a hyphen if it would be capitalized without the hyphen or it's the last word.
    * Examples
        * *Self-Paced Training for Microsoft Visual Studio*
        * *Microsoft Management Console: Five Essential Snap-Ins*
        * *Five Essential Snap-ins for Microsoft Management Console*
        * *Copy-and-Paste Support in Windows Apps*
7. Capitalize the first word of labels and terms that appear in UI and APIs unless they're always lowercase (for example, `ls`).
8. In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
